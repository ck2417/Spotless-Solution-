b. API Used
Cleaning Tips: Custom local data array (simulating API-style behavior)

Weather API: API Ninjas - Weather Endpoint (https://api-ninjas.com/api/weather)
(Integrated, optional fallback if issues persist)

c. Project Description
This is a multi-page responsive carpet cleaning website built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6). It features modern design, smooth user interaction, and clean layout principles. The website includes service descriptions, a contact form, gallery, testimonials, pricing calculator, and interactive quote sections.

Flexbox was used extensively for layout alignment and responsiveness. All styling is done with custom CSS. Bootstrap was not used.

d. Custom Requirement
To meet the API integration requirement:

A cleaning tips section was created with a rotating list of useful, educational carpet care tips shown each time the user clicks a button.

Although the tips are locally sourced for better control and accuracy, the structure simulates a real API.

A weather API integration was also attempted using API Ninjas to show local weather conditions (to inform users of drying conditions).
